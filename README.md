We are Team Titans. We are participating in Game of Codes event of Cognitia'23 NIT Meghalaya. We have created a tic tac toe game using HTML5, CSS and JavaScript. Our game includes the following features:
1. A beautiful yet simple interface has been made to make the game look appealing but also not complex.
2. Whenever a turn is played, a music is played which makes the game fun and interesting.
3. When the game finishes, a song is played  around which gives a wholesome vibe to the game.
4. A reset or new button has been added to reset the game after draw or winning game.
